# Guess The Song

I design and implement a location-based song guessing game on the for the Android platform. In the game, users could collect song lyrics from locations based around the Bay Campus (Swansea University); however, later implemented the ability to collect lyrics in any place. The App was developed in Kotlin. I chose Kotlin over Java as I had the desire to learn a new language and further to that it is the language android are pushing the developer at the time of writing. Developed during my final year at Swansea University studying computer science.
