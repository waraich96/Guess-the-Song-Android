# Guess The Song

I designed and implemented a location-based song guessing game for the Android platform. In the game, users could collect song lyrics from locations based around the Bay Campus (Swansea University); however, later implemented the ability to collect lyrics in any place. The App was developed in Kotlin. I chose Kotlin over Java as I had the desire to learn a new language and further to that it is the language android are pushing developers to use Developed during my final year at Swansea University studying Bsc Computer Science.
